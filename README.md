Welcome to ICRA 2020, the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation.

ICRA is the largest robotics meeting in the world and is the flagship conference of the IEEE Robotics & Automation Society. It is thus our honor and pleasure to welcome you to this edition, although the current exceptional circumstances did not allow us to organize it with the glimpse and splendor that our wonderful robotics community deserves.

ICRA 2020 received 3,512 submissions, a new record, from 64 countries and 14,665 authors. Overall, 3,446 papers were reviewed: 2,456 for ICRA 2020 and 990 for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L). The 10 most popular keywords, in descending order, were: Deep Learning in Robotics and Automation, Motion and Path Planning, Localization, Learning and Adaptive Systems, Autonomous Vehicle Navigation, Multi-Robot Systems, SLAM, Object Detection, Segmentation and Categorization, and Visual-Based Navigation. From the very large number of submitted high-quality papers the ICRA 2020 senior program committee selected 1,483 for presentation, which represents an acceptance rate of 42%. The conference review process was overseen by the Editor-in-chief of the Conference Editorial Board (CEB) which comprises 20 editors, 409 associate editors and 9,425 reviewers. RA-L, TRO, and RAM papers were reviewed by their respective editorial boards. Overall we have 1,534 papers in these proceedings and for the vast majority, there will be presentation videos attached to them in the program.
